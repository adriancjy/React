For code wise,
look at src/views/pages/login.js for the login page. This page appears by default.
Login is hardcoded right now at test@hotmail.com and 12345678.

look at src/views/dashboard/analyticsDashboard.js for the dashboard page after logging in.
Apexchart can be changed to suit whatever to reflect. What to replace the card with has been commented in.

look at src/views/tables/regular.js for the transaction history.
Can apply API to populate the dropdown and then render the table again.

Other tabs on the nav and the remaining trash stuff can be removed again.
